# DevOps Labs
This repo holds a serie of basic cloud architecture used mostly to guide newbies around cloud architecture

Check the README.md inside each directory to see a reference of each architecture.

## Dependencies
These examples expect you to have installed [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) locally. Although [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) is not required you might need it to troubleshoot things.

## Using the examples
If you wanna check the results of running the examples, you can execute `terraform plan` locally to see the resources the example would create. Just ensure you have the proper [AWS environment variables configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) on your environment.
